# MIC-1

MIC-1 processor implementation in rust language.

> The MIC-1 is a processor architecture invented by Andrew S. Tanenbaum to use as a simple but complete example in his
> teaching book Structured Computer Organization.

The implementation uses [tree-sitter-jas](https://github.com/AlexPl292/tree-sitter-jas) parser for parsing jas assembly.

See `main.rs` for the program example.
